title: Who am I?
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>
I am a chemical engineer researching nanoparticle/colloidal self-assembly using computational
methods.
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Glotzer lab at the University of Michigan.
Previously, I was a Ph.D. student in the McCabe group at Vanderbilt University, where I developed
coarse-grained models to study lipid self-assembly.
The common thread weaving together my graduate and doctoral work is self-assembly: how do basic
building blocks arrange themselves in ordered structures with emergent properties?
My Ph.D. research focused on understanding how the lipids in your skin arrange themselves to form
structure with strong <i>barrier</i> properties.
I am currently studying the extent to which shape can influence the self-assembly of colloidal and
nanoparticle systems.

Outside of science, I am a husband, father, and amateur runner, cyclist, gardener and baker. 
I have been married to Meredith since 2014, and we have two sons, Reid and Gibson.
