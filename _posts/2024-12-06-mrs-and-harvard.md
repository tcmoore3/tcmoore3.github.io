Busy week!
In addition to catching up folks and seeing many wonderful talks at MRS Fall this week, I also gave two talks. 
First, I presented my work on modeling gold nanocube self-assembly at MRS.
Then, I presented at the [Squishy Physics](https://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/schedule/squishy-physics) seminar, a series hosted by the Weitz Group at Harvard and open to all soft matter scientists in and around Boston.
Huge thanks to [Haicho Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haichao-wu/) for setting up the talk at Harvard!
