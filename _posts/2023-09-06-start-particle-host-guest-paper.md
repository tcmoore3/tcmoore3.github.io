Huge congratulations to [Tobias](https://www.tobiasdwyer.com/) on the publication of his first manuscript as the lead author!
In [our new manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3SM00891F), we explore the role of the shape of guest particles in the entropy-driven self-assembly of host--guest structures.
We show that both the size and shape of the guest particles impact the types of structures that form.
Further, we quantify the degree of *entropy compartmentalization* present in these assemblies, showing how the interplay between the strong localization of the host particles and
the free space afforded to the guest particles in the host--guest structures dictates how the particles arrange themselves.

This work follows [my previous work](https://doi.org/10.1039/D0SM02073G) on hard particle systems that assemble into host--guest structures.
In that paper, we showed how binary hard particle systems can provide a route to open structures; the new paper demonstrates that this phenomenon is
not specific to the systems I was studying and provides quantitative evidence that entropy compartmentalization plays a key role.
