Allen's paper on the self-assembly of binary nanoparticle superlattices is now [published in _PRL_](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.188001).
In it, we show how two-component systems that are _off-stoichiometry_ compared to the stable crystalline phase can counterintuitively assemble into the stable binary structure better than systems that are on-stoichiometry.
