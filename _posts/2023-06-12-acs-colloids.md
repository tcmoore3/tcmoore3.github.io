I just got back from the 97th ACS Colloid and Surface Science Symposium held on the campus of my alma mater, North
Carolina State University.
I gave a talk about the [work I have done](https://doi.org/10.1039/D0SM02073G) on designing colloidal systems to
form open structures and chaired one of the seesions of self- and directed assembly.

After the conference, I gave a talk to several groups in the Department of Applied Physical Sciences at UNC, hosted by former Glotzer Group postdoc Daphne Klotsa.
