Our [recent work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-024-00102-9) studying the self-assembly of gold nanocubes under liquid cell TEM (LCTEM) illumination is now published in _Nature Chemical Engineering_ and will be featured on the cover of the August edition.
This project was a collaboration with [Xingchen Ye](https://ye.lab.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University Bloomington.
