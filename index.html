Hello!
I am a computational soft matter scientist at the University of Michigan.
I <a href="/research/">study</a> how order emerges from simple rules in otherwise chaotic systems, with applications in developing new materials by design.
<br>
<br>
I am also an active contributor to the high-quality open source software tools developed and maintained by the <a href="https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/"> the Glotzer Group</a>.
I have made significant contributions to the group's particle simulation toolkit, <a href="https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">HOOMD-blue</a>, as well as to the <a href="https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Freud</a> analysis toolkit and the <a href="https://docs.signac.io/en/latest/">Signac</a> data management framework.
